Hello, the three of us are a group of close friends who all have a passion for video games with a hope of getting into game development; together we decided to partake in our first Global Game Jam and create our first ever game in just 3 days. 
While this has been a challange with none of us having ever made a video game, we utalised the skills we had prior to the project; Joseph having made simple games in Python and Java, Ella being a freelance artist, and Alex having made music in his spare time. Although this was our first attempt at making a game, combining our individual skills has allowed us to create a project that we are proud to have as a first of many games to come.
